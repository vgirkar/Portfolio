                <h3>Automated Essay Evaluation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implemented using Natural Language Processing, it aimed to build an automated essay evaluator using a dataset of nearly 1300 essays from Kaggle.com.</li>
                    <li>Extracted features such as total word count per essay, sentence count, number of long words, parts of speech.</li>
                    <li>Used 5-fold cross-validation to train and test the model rigorously. Quadratic Weighted Kappa was used as an error metric.</li>
