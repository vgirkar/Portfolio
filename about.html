            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, I create a new templating programming language for HTML using Kotlin. This novel language, called Kata, enables the UI team to develop user-facing components with enhanced features and performance. I have been instrumental in developing various language operators, such as optional chaining and exception handling, for Kata. Prior to Amazon, I worked as a Junior Software Engineer at Cover Fox Insurance, where I optimized the credit approval process using innovative tech solutions. I designed and implemented an auto-generated CAM report with instant approval metrics, which reduced the TAT by around 80%. I also developed eKYC and eMandate modules for seamless customer onboarding. Additionally, I served as a Teaching Assistant at UNCC, where I imparted knowledge on Data Structures and Algorithms, ensuring student success. I hold a Master of Computer Science from UNCC and a Bachelor of Engineering in IT from VIT, India. I am fluent in Java, SQL, Kotlin, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Ruby, and proficient with frameworks like Spring MVC, React.JS, Angular, and Hibernate. I believe in constant learning, innovation, and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. I am always open to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts and exploring new opportunities.</p>
